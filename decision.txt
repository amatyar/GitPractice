What is decision table testing and why is it important?
Decision table testing is the perfect test case design technique for verifying complex business rules and scenarios systematically and concisely. It is the software test design technique in black box testing that is utilized for multiple outputs or on multiple conditions that are required to be tested. This technique is highly effective for testing system behavior for different input combinations and is commonly referred to as a Cause-Effect table. A Decision Table enables you to check all possible combinations of conditions for testing and easily identify missed conditions by indicating them as True(T) and False(F) values.

70. when and Why we use decision tables?
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called ’cause-effect graphing’ which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
